                "Lauren and the team of Tutors at â€‹LH Educational Services are nothing short of consummate professionals in everything they do. From our initial meeting to welcoming them back into our Football Club, the service has been faultless and for that reason alone, we will look forward to welcoming them back next season and forging future collaborations for the benefit of our Academy players.",
                "Initially, we made contact with Lauren to source an approved, quality assured Maths Tutor with a proven track record of success. Not only that, but someone who recognised the challenges of young football players, their previous educational experiences and mindset when approaching GCSE Examinations. Kerry was that and much more, to such an extent that both players commented that they could only wish they had received similar teaching and learning at their respective schools. Lauren is fully supportive of the work we are trying to carry out in our Academy, that no player should have to choose between Education and Football and that both elements are not mutually exclusive, but imperative in their future development and transition.",
                "Player's parents have also commented on the standard and quality of the GCSE Examination Prep session Lauren planned, designed and delivered to our U16's previously this season. A driving factor for us to repeat this session again next season, as we aim to add value to the revision, hints, tips and techniques being provided by schools, with the overriding objective to achieve marginal gains and allow players to in turn achieve their individual potential. Furthermore, we look forward to expanding the delivery of tutoring and supportive sessions to other other age groups to continue to improve our current Programme and meet the Educational needs of our Academy players."
